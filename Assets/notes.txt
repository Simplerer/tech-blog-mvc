--------

passing the property of layout in render can change the main template

- like this ----

res.render('which view', { datas: datas, layout: 'otherLayout' });

in layout folder ---> otherLayout.handlebars

this works with user too

res.render('which view', { datas: datas, user: 'user' });

use {{user}} in templates
