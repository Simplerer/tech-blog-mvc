-07 dish-routes shows how to get data to render

const thisData = await This.findByPk(req.params.id);

const this = thisData.get({ plain: true })

can also do 

const thisData = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(thisData))

ALSO const this = thisData.map(data => data.get({ plain: true }));
   - this is foer looping through all, though JSON sandwich works also

either is used before 

res. render('where this is going', this)
